Trendsetter Challenge
Use this dataset to answer the following
Definitions
<ul>
<li>Assume a “trendsetter” is someone who, in this dataset, visits some of the same
locations as another person, before the other person goes to that location.</li>
<li>A “trendsetter score” for a person is the number of distinct locations and people that
have visited a location after the "trendsetter".</li>
<li>A "radius of influence" for a trendsetter is an approximate measurement of the radius of
the circle that bounds the places that person has checked in. Assume the earth is flat.</li>
</ul>
Deliverables
<p>Two tables containing ten rows including the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li>user_id of the trendsetter</li>
<li>Trendsetter score</li>
<li>Radius of influence</li>
</ul>
<p>First table displays trendsetters ranked by score, highest to lowest</p>
<p>Second table displays trendsetters ranked by radius of influence, highest to lowest</p>
